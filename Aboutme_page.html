    <p>My name is Nicholas Cifarelli and I am studying Software Engineering at Florida Gulf Coast University. I have experience in the industry considering the internship I endured at Arthrex working directly with the Desktop Support Team, Cyber Security Team and the Infrastruce and Design Team. This opened my eyes to the various fields of IT and Software Engineering. I feel as though it has also been to my benefit that I am culturally diverse in the sense that I have also studied in Rome, Italy. </p>
